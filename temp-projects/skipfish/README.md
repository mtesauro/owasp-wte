Skipfish is an active web application security reconnaissance tool. It prepares an interactive sitemap for the targeted site by carrying out a recursive crawl and dictionary-based probes. The resulting map is then annotated with the output from a number of active (but hopefully non-disruptive) security checks. The final report generated by the tool is meant to serve as a foundation for professional web application security assessments.

The project site can be found at: https://code.google.com/p/skipfish/

Note: This is a meta-package that relies on the skipfish provided by the Linux distribution.
